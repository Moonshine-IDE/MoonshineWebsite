Third Party Hosting

Third party hosts may be utilized for services such as colocation, redundant backup, and disaster recovery. **STARTcloud will use third party hosts only upon the direct request of a Customer.** In the event that hosting services are provided by a third party, topics specific to the STARTcloud SLA will apply only to services conducted at the STARTcloud data centers. Any inability to connect to STARTcloud-hosted services due to failures or improperly configured services at a third party hosting facility (including but not limited to DNS services, VPNs, or Internet transport solutions) shall not be considered as outages of STARTcloud hosted solutions. Services hosted by the third parties shall be subject to their respective service level agreements, particularly as it applies to physical and network security, network uptime, server availability and scheduled maintenance.

Scope of Service
---

### Network Uptime

STARTcloud guarantees that its network will be available 99.99% of the time, corresponding specifically to no more than 5 minutes of downtime in a given month, excluding scheduled maintenance.

Network uptime includes functioning of all STARTcloud network infrastructure, including routers, switches and cabling, but does not include applications or services running on a customer’s server, nor does it include general internet outages beyond STARTcloud ISPs’ local points of presence. Network downtime exists when  
(1) the customer’s server is unable to transmit and receive data due to a problem with the STARTcloud network infrastructure;  
(2) STARTcloud determines in its reasonable commercial judgment that a network outage does indeed exist; and  
(3) the customer has opened a support incident with STARTcloud Customer Support. Network downtime is measured from the time a support incident is opened by the customer to the time the network outage is resolved.  

### Server Availability

STARTcloud defines server availability as the availability of port 80 (HTTP) and, when applicable, ports 1352 (Lotus Domino) and/or port 22 (SSH). STARTcloud makes the following server availability guarantees:

Development Servers (including shared servers and dedicated development servers): No more than 8 hours of downtime in a given month, excluding scheduled maintenance, equating to an approximate availability of 99%.

Production Servers (including partitioned servers and dedicated production servers): No more than 45 minutes of downtime in a given month, excluding scheduled maintenance, equating to an approximate availability of 99.9%.

Server downtime exists when  
(1) any of the applicable monitored ports on the customer’s server are no longer available for service;  
(2) STARTcloud determines in its reasonable commercial judgment that a server outage does indeed exist; and  
(3) the customer has opened a support incident with STARTcloud Customer Support. Server downtime is measured from the time a support incident is opened by the customer to the time the server downtime issue is resolved.  

This server availability guarantee applies to STARTcloud’s production (shared), development (partitioned), and dedicated hosting services. All other services, including but not limited to mail, SSL, site statistics, secondary registration, and merchant services are not covered by this guarantee and offer no service guarantees.

### Network and Server Exclusions

Network downtime and server unavailability will not include outages that the customer fails to report within five (5) business days, or outages resulting from: STARTcloud scheduled maintenance; telephone company circuits; customer applications, equipment or facilities; acts or omissions by the customer, or any use or user of customer; or reasons of *force majeure*.

### Hardware Guarantee

STARTcloud guarantees the operability of all leased hardware components and will replace at no cost to the customer any failed components. STARTcloud reserves the right to substitute comparable or better hardware for failed components. Hardware replacement for critical failures will begin upon identification of the problem. Hardware replacement for noncritical failures may be delayed to a standard maintenance window at STARTcloud’s sole discretion.
All hardware replacement is guaranteed to be finished within four (4) hours, however, this explicitly excludes the time required to rebuild a RAID array.

### Scheduled Maintenance 

Scheduled Maintenance shall mean any maintenance in the STARTcloud data center at which the customer’s server is located  
(a) of which the customer is notified at least 24 hours in advance, or  
(b) that is performed during the standard maintenance windows of Wednesday and Sunday from 12 AM to 4 AM U.S. Central Time, or  
(c) that is conducted at a mutually agreed upon time.  
Notice of scheduled maintenance will be provided to the customer’s account contact(s) via e-mail, fax or phone. STARTcloud will use its best efforts to respect geographic time differences and/or business hours of its customers when conducting scheduled maintenance.
 
### Customer Support 

STARTcloud strives to provide quality technical support to its customers. STARTcloud offers 30 minutes of included support to each account per month. Support includes, but is not limited to server connection issues, client and server software installation, new service registration, mail routing issues, server configuration, DNS issues and application operation issues. STARTcloud will assist with any non-application design related questions you have, within the allotted free support period. Support beyond the initial 30 minutes is billed at the standard support rate.

The official channel for obtaining technical support from STARTcloud is via e-mail at support@moonshine-ide.com. Sending an e-mail to this address will result in the generation and return e-mailing of a message identification number (MID). Customer must retain this MID number for reference. STARTcloud will respond to all technical support requests within two (2) business days and will make every attempt to resolve these technical inquiries within this time frame. Noncritical and general requests will be given lower priority. Critical problems that affect the day to day operations of a Customer’s account will be given a high priority and every attempt will be made to resolve these types of problems in the shortest time frame possible.

STARTcloud takes no responsibility for the reliability of e-mail transmission. If a response was sent to the Customer by STARTcloud and can be found in the STARTcloud Contact Management system, customer will not qualify for credits regardless of whether or not the Customer actually received the response from STARTcloud.

Customers may also attempt to obtain support by phone during normal business hours by calling 888.356.2999 (U.S.) or +1.217.356.2999 (international); however, the official channel for support remains via e-mail. STARTcloud makes no guarantee of the availability of phone support at any time. In all cases, for the safety of customers, only registered technical contacts are eligible to open support incidents for an account.
 
### Remedy & Credits 

If STARTcloud determines in its reasonable commercial judgment that it has failed to reach any aspect of its Service Level Agreement, STARTcloud will, upon customer’s request, credit customer’s account the prorated base charges of each affected server for one day’s service for each continuous 24 hour period that the failure exists. Only one SLA parameter violation may be claimed per event. Redundant or clustered networks designed to prevent outages in the event one or more components of the network fail shall be eligible for credit solely to the extent that STARTcloud determines a complete outage exists. The customer has five (5) business days to submit a request for credit to STARTcloud. Any failures not reported within five (5) business days are not eligible for credits.

Credits will apply only to the base monthly rate of the customer’s selected hosting package. Credits will issue on the first day of the month following the outage and will deduct from the amount due for the following month’s service. Credits will not be applied directly to a credit card, via cash or check, or in any manner other than a service credit for the following month. Customers with multiple servers will not receive credits for unaffected servers. Customers will not be credited on a daily basis more than the prorated daily amount of their base monthly hosting rate, and not more than the amount of their total monthly hosting rate in any given month. 

This document may be modified at any time and will be in effect 30 days after online posting.
