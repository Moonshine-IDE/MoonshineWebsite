Billing and Payment Policy
===

General Terms
---

By subscribing to a STARTcloud service, you enter into an agreement to pay for that service. You may choose to pay either via electronic funds transfer or by check. Credit card payments may be accepted at the sole discretion of STARTcloud and may incur a service fee calculated based on your geographic location. All services are paid for in annual installments unless otherwise specified in your proposal and Master Service Agreement (MSA).
 
Invoicing
---

You will be invoiced electronically via email on NET 30 terms; no paper invoices will be mailed. All invoices are considered final 60 days from the date of the invoice. Any billing disputes must be raised within this timeframe. All invoices charges are in US Dollars. 

Payment is due by the date specified on the invoice regardless of payment method. Delinquent accounts are subject to a $10 late fee per payment period, plus daily interest accrued at a rate of 18% per annum. STARTcloud may, at its sole discretion, extend a limited grace period to customer accounts in good standing.

Credit card payments may be accepted at the sole discretion of STARTcloud and may incur a service fee calculated based on your geographic location. Customers with recurring monthly payments will have charges initiated to their credit card on or around the 1st day of the service period.

Termination and Suspension
---

It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that payment arrives on time in accordance with this policy and the MSA regardless of the payment method chosen. After 15 days, any account with a delinquent payment may have services suspended until payment is received. In accordance with the MSA, any account with a delinquent payment may be permanently closed and any data associated with the account may be deleted. The decision to grant a grace period, suspend, or terminate an account for nonpayment remains the sole discretion of STARTcloud. 

STARTcloud, Inc. accepts no responsibility for loss of business, lost data, or any other loss resulting from an account which is suspended or terminated for non-payment. STARTcloud will attempt to contact those accounts with past due balances by sending an e-mail to the designated billing contacts on the account; however, STARTcloud is not responsible for outdated contact information. It is the customer’s responsibility to keep contact information up to date. Please log-in to the customer portal or contact our customer support team to update contact information. 

STARTcloud, Inc. may be able to re-establish recently closed accounts with those services billed at our then current support rate, but makes no guarantee whatsoever about the availability of data. We will inform you if data is not available at the time you request to re-establish an account terminated for nonpayment.
 
Advanced Payments and Discounts
---

Customer may choose to pay in advance for a period of time for service. All payments are considered a commitment to service and are nonrefundable once paid. Advance discounts, prepayment discounts, term length discounts or other discounts may be offered for services contingent upon satisfactory fulfillment of certain customer obligations. In the event services are provided at a reduced rate, but the terms for which the discount was offered are not fulfilled, STARTcloud reserves the right to immediately bill the difference between the reduced rate paid and the full standard rate.
