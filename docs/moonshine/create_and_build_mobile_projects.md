## Create and Build Mobile Projects

1. To create a new mobile based **Apache Flex®** project do either one the following things:
   * In Moonshine choose `File -> New -> Flex Mobile Project (iOS, Android)` : MXML and ActionScript support.
   * Choose _Flex Mobile Project (iOS, Android)_ in Moonshine splash screen.
  
2. Choosing any above option will open new project creation dialogue:

    Editable fields are:
     * Project Name
     * Parent Directory

3. After necessary inputs in the fields above, click _Create_ to generate a new **Apache Flex®** Mobile project.

4. _Create_ option immediately creates a new **Apache Flex®** project, opens the project in Moonshine workspace (left-hand tree menu) and makes it an application file in Moonshine editor.

5. Moonshine generates any project with its supported types with demo 'Hello World!' text, so you can immediately build the project and check it’s output. An optional **Apache Ant®** build script is fully configured so you can build a mobile package (.apk or .ipa) immediately as well!

6. To run the project choose `Project -> Build & Run`. You can see command line outputs in Moonshine’s console window (at bottom)
